This yields very natural sounding speech and music because the network learns the waveform structure end-to-end.\n\n## 2. Core\n\n### 2.1 Causal convolutions\nA causal 1D convolution ensures predictions at time \\(t\\) don't depend on future samples:\n- Achieved by padding only on the left (past).\n- In practice, use `padding = dilation * (kernel_size - 1)` and then trim the rightmost elements (or use `Chomp1d` cropping).\n\n### 2.2 Dilated convolutions\nDilations `[1, 2, 4, 8, ...]` in stacked layers let the receptive field grow exponentially with depth while keeping the number of parameters manageable. A stack of several cycles of dilations covers long temporal context (hundreds to thousands of samples).\n\n### 2.3 Gated activation units\nEach residual block uses a gated unit:\n$\n\\text{z} = \\tanh(W_f * x) \\odot \\sigma(W_g * x)\n$\nwhere `*` is dilated causal conv, `W_f` and `W_g` are convolution filters. The output splits to (1) residual connection and (2) skip connection that is added to final output.\n\n### 2.4 Residual & skip connections\n- Residual: `x_{l+1} = x_l + \\text{residual\\_out}` to ease training.\n- Skip: every block outputs a skip tensor; all skip outputs are summed, then passed through post-processing (ReLU, Conv, softmax) to produce the final distribution over quantized samples.\n\n### 2.5 Output quantization / softmax\nAudio samples are often µ-law quantized to 256 values; WaveNet predicts a categorical distribution (`softmax(256)`) over those values for each time step. Continuous outputs are also possible (mixture of logistics / Gaussians) but discrete softmax is standard in the original paper.\n\n### 2.6 Conditioning\n- **Global conditioning**: a per-utterance vector (e.g., speaker id embedding) is added to layer activations.\n- **Local conditioning**: low-rate features (e.g., mel spectrogram) are upsampled (transposed conv / nearest) and added at each time step.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Training & sampling\n\n### Training\n- Teacher forcing: at training time the network receives true previous samples and learns to predict the next sample with cross-entropy loss (if quantized).\n- Batch size and optimization: use Adam, gradient clipping recommended for stability.\n- Preprocess: µ-law companding + 256-level quantization is common.\n\n### Sampling (inference)\n- Autoregressive generation: sample one sample at a time and feed it back.\n- Slow by default — many acceleration techniques exist (distillation → Parallel Wavenet, caching convolutions, WaveRNN, etc.).\n\n\n\n**Reference:** [WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio* (van den Oord et al., DeepMind, 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -q torchaudio\n# !pip install git+git://github.com/pytorch/audio\nimport torchaudio\nimport os","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-19T21:13:32.513862Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-19T21:13:32.514079Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-19T21:14:49.149031Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-19T21:13:32.514061Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-19T21:14:49.148175Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m363.4/363.4 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m4.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m:00:01\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m13.8/13.8 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m78.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m:00:01\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m24.6/24.6 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m68.3 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m:00:01\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m883.7/883.7 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m37.3 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m664.8/664.8 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m:00:01\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m211.5/211.5 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m7.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m:00:01\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m56.3/56.3 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m15.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m:00:01\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m127.9/127.9 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m13.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m207.5/207.5 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m8.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m:00:01\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m21.1/21.1 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m7.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m0:00:01\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[?25h\u001b[31mERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.

Sampling Rate and Bit Depth\n\n### Sound as a Signal\nSound in the real world is a **continuous analog waveform** — a pressure signal that varies smoothly over time.  \nTo process it digitally, we **sample** it: we take discrete measurements of the amplitude at equally spaced time intervals.\n\nThis process converts a continuous signal into a **time series of numbers**:\n$\nx = [x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_T]\n$\nwhere each \\(x_t\\) represents the air pressure (or voltage) at time step \\(t\\).\n\n---\n\n### Sampling Rate\nThe **sampling rate** defines **how many times per second** we measure the amplitude of the signal.  \nTypical values:\n- CD quality audio: 44,100 Hz (samples per second)\n- Speech datasets: 16,000 Hz or 22,050 Hz\n\nA higher sampling rate means more detail, but also more data to process.  \nWaveNet typically models 16 kHz or 22 kHz audio for speech generation tasks.\n\n---\n\n### Bit Depth\nEach recorded sample must be represented by a finite number of bits.  \nThe **bit depth** determines the range and precision of these values:\n- 8-bit → 256 possible levels  \n- 16-bit → 65,536 levels  \n- 24-bit → 16,777,216 levels  \n\nThe bit depth affects the **signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)** — higher bit depth means less quantization noise and a larger dynamic range:\n$\n\\text{SNR} \\approx 6.02 \\times \\text{bit depth} + 1.76\\ \\text{dB}\n$\n\nFor example:\n- 8-bit ≈ 49.9 dB SNR  \n- 16-bit ≈ 98 dB SNR\n\n---\n\n## 2. From Audio to Time Series\n\nAfter digitization, the audio signal becomes a **sequence of numbers over time**, also known as a **time series**.  \nEach point depends on previous ones — this temporal dependency is what WaveNet models autoregressively:\n$\np(x_{1:T}) = \\prod_{t=1}^{T} p(x_t \\mid x_{<t})\n$\n\nHowever, raw 16-bit audio contains **too many values** (65,536 possible amplitudes).  \nPredicting the exact next value among that huge range is extremely hard for a neural network.\n\nTo simplify, we reduce this dynamic range to a smaller set — typically **256 levels** — using a technique called **µ-law companding**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. µ-law Quantization (Companding Transformation)\n\n### Motivation\nHuman hearing follows the **Weber–Fechner law** — our perception of changes in loudness is **logarithmic**, not linear.  \nThat means we are more sensitive to small amplitude changes in quiet sounds than in loud ones.\n\nµ-law companding exploits this property by **compressing the amplitude range logarithmically** —  \nit allocates more resolution to small signals (quiet sounds) and less to large ones.\n\n---\n\n### µ-law Formula\n\n$\nf(x) = \\text{sign}(x) \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(1 + \\mu |x|)}{\\ln(1 + \\mu)}, \\quad -1 \\le x \\le 1\n$\n\nwhere:\n- \\(x\\) = input waveform (normalized to [-1, 1])  \n- \\(\\mu\\) = companding constant (usually 255 for 8-bit quantization)\n\nAfter applying µ-law, we map the range \\([-1, 1]\\) to discrete integer values \\([0, 255]\\).\n\n---\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Defining Wavenet\n\n20 Points","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The following figure describes the overall architecture of WaveNet.

Question 2: Pixel CNN / Pixel RNN (Optional)\n\nIn this question, we explore **deep autoregressive models** for image generation, focusing on PixelCNN and PixelRNN.  \n\nNatural images are high-dimensional and exhibit strong spatial correlations between neighboring pixels. The **PixelRNN** aims to model the **full joint distribution** of pixel intensities, enabling exact likelihood computation and realistic image generation.  \n\nUnlike VAEs or GANs, which rely on latent variables or adversarial training, PixelRNN treats the **image as a sequence of pixels** and directly models:  \n\n$$\np(\\mathbf{x}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i \\mid x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{i-1})\n$$\n\nHere, each pixel \\(x_i\\) is conditioned on all previously generated pixels, following a fixed **raster-scan order** (top-left → bottom-right). This transforms image modeling into a **sequence modeling task**, allowing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture long-range spatial dependencies.  \n\n---\n\n### Core Idea\n\nPixelRNN introduces **two-dimensional LSTM architectures** to preserve autoregressive dependencies in images:\n\n- **Row LSTM:** Processes the image row by row (left-to-right), with recurrent connections across both rows and columns.  \n- **Diagonal Bi-LSTM:** Processes pixels along diagonals, increasing the receptive field to include all previously generated pixels.  \n\nTo maintain causality across color channels, each pixel’s RGB values are generated sequentially (R → G → B).  \n\n![PixelRNN Architecture](image.png)\n\n---\n\n### Architectural Components\n\n1. **Masked Convolutions**  \n   Convolutional filters are masked (type A or B) to prevent access to future pixels or channels during training.  \n\n2. **Residual Connections**  \n   Stacked recurrent layers use residual links to facilitate gradient flow in deep networks.  \n\n3. **Discrete Softmax Output**  \n   Each pixel channel is modeled as a categorical distribution over 256 intensity values, allowing exact log-likelihood computation.  \n\n4. **Loss Function**  \n   The training objective is the **negative log-likelihood** of the true pixels under the predicted distributions:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = -\\sum_i \\log p(x_i \\mid x_{<i})\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Sampling and Generation\n\nImage generation in PixelRNN is **fully autoregressive**:\n\n1. Start at the top-left pixel.  \n2. Sequentially sample each pixel from its predicted conditional distribution.  \n3. Repeat until the entire image is generated.  \n\nThis method produces coherent, high-quality images but is computationally intensive, as each pixel depends on all previously generated pixels.  \n\n---\n\n**Reference:** [PixelRNN Paper (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## load Cifar10\n\n5 Points","metadata":{"id":"cQss1Y83nYf1"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport math\nimport struct\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport torch\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nimport torchvision.transforms.functional as F\n\n#TODO\n\nIMAGE_SIZE = 24\nNUM_CLASSES = 10\nNUM_EXAMPLES_PER_EPOCH_FOR_TRAIN = 50000\nNUM_EXAMPLES_PER_EPOCH_FOR_EVAL = 10000\n\n\ndef _read_cifar10_binary_file(path: str) -> List[Tuple[int, np.ndarray]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a single CIFAR-10 binary file and returns a list of (label, image_array)\n    where image_array is HxWxC uint8 (32x32x3).\n    CIFAR-10 binary format: 1 byte label followed by 3072 bytes image (R(1024), G(1024), B(1024))\n    \"\"\"\n    records = []\n    record_size = 1 + 32 * 32 * 3\n    with open(path, 'rb') as f:\n        while True:\n            bytes_read = f.read(record_size)\n            if not bytes_read:\n                break\n            if len(bytes_read) != record_size:\n                raise ValueError(f\"Unexpected record size in {path}: {len(bytes_read)} bytes\")\n            # first byte is label\n            label = bytes_read[0]\n            img_flat = np.frombuffer(bytes_read[1:], dtype=np.uint8)\n            # image is stored as [R..1024, G..1024, B..1024] each row-major for 32x32\n            # reshape to (3, 32, 32) then transpose to (32, 32, 3)\n            depth_major = img_flat.reshape((3, 32, 32))\n            img = np.transpose(depth_major, (1, 2, 0))  # H, W, C\n            records.append((int(label), img))\n    return records\n\nclass CIFAR10BinaryDataset(Dataset):\n    \"\"\"\n    Dataset that reads the CIFAR-10 binary files into memory (list of (label, image)).\n    Applies transforms (train/eval) provided in init.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, data_dir: str, files: List[str], transform=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        data_dir: directory containing the CIFAR-10 binary files.\n        files: list of filenames (basename) to read from data_dir.\n        transform: torchvision transform to apply to PIL image (or custom transform).\n        \"\"\"\n        self.data_dir = data_dir\n        self.files = files\n        self.transform = transform\n\n        # Load all records into memory (50k images is fine)\n        self.records: List[Tuple[int, np.ndarray]] = []\n        for fname in files:\n            path = os.path.join(data_dir, fname)\n            if not os.path.exists(path):\n                raise ValueError(f\"Failed to find file: {path}\")\n            self.records.extend(_read_cifar10_binary_file(path))\n\n        if len(self.records) == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"No records loaded from CIFAR files.\")\n\n    def __len__(self):\n        return len(self.records)\n\n    def __getitem__(self, idx):\n        label, img_np = self.records[idx]\n        # Convert to PIL Image (expects HxW or HxWxC)\n        img = Image.fromarray(img_np)  # mode='RGB'\n        if self.transform:\n            img = self.transform(img)\n        # After transforms, we expect a torch.FloatTensor image of shape [C, H, W]\n        # Return label as long tensor\n        return img, torch.tensor(label, dtype=torch.long)\n\n\nclass PerImageStandardization:\n    \"\"\"\n    Mimics TensorFlow's per_image_standardization:\n      (x - mean) / max(stddev, 1.0/sqrt(N))\n    Works on a torch tensor image with shape (C, H, W) and dtype=float32 in range [0,1] or raw values.\n    We'll expect inputs are float tensors in range [0,1].\n    \"\"\"\n    def __call__(self, tensor: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # tensor: C x H x W\n        if not torch.is_floating_point(tensor):\n            tensor = tensor.float()\n        mean = tensor.mean()\n        std = tensor.std()\n        # N = number of pixels * channels\n        N = tensor.numel()\n        std_min = 1.0 / math.sqrt(N)\n        std_adj = max(std.item(), std_min)\n        return (tensor - mean) / std_adj\n\n\ndef _train_transform():\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns torchvision transform for training (distortions similar to TF code):\n    - Random crop to IMAGE_SIZE x IMAGE_SIZE from 32x32 image\n    - Random horizontal flip\n    - Random brightness and contrast (approximate TF random_brightness/random_contrast)\n    - Convert to tensor (0..1)\n    - Per-image standardization\n    \"\"\"\n    # ColorJitter's brightness and contrast ranges take a factor.
